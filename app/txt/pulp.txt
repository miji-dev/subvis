about leaving that island alive,

so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

972

your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki-

973

in his life-

put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

ever saw the watch,

it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

this watch was your birthright.

that pitch- Jimmie's a friend.

You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

Just tell him
not to be abusive.

He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

Put yourself in his position-
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

He wasn't expectin' this shit.

- You watched me wash 'em.

- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

Okay, first thing.
You two.

Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

- That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.

Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

need to take care of are the really messy parts.

the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:32,600
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2087
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:34,600
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2088
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:37,500
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right! - I promise!

2089
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,500
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2090
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:41,500
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2091
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:45,000
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2092
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2093
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,600
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

2094
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:55,300
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like? - He's cool.

2095
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,300
- What?
- Cool.

2096
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:00,200
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2097
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:02,200
We're gonna be cool.

2098
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:07,200
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2099
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,300
And when I count three,

2100
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:12,300
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2101
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:15,900
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2102
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:19,000
And when you do it,

2103
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:21,100
you do it cool.

2104
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,600
You ready?

2105
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,700
One,

2106
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:28,000
two,

2107
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,000
three.

2108
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,100
- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

2109
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:43,800
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

2110
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,900
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2111
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,200
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

2112
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:55,100
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2113
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,600
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2114
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:00,600
But I don't want that.

2115
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:02,600
And you don't want that.

2116
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:05,400
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2117
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:07,600
So let's see what we can do.

2118
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,200
Now... here's the situation.

2119
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:17,100
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2120
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:20,700
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2121
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:23,600
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2122
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:27,700
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2123
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:30,700
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

2124
02:24:30,700 --> 02:24:33,700
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2125
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,600
- Vincent!
- [ Yells ]

2126
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:38,600
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

2127
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:41,400
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2128
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:45,600
- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.
There you go. - [ Yolanda Whimpering ]

2129
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:47,700
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2130
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:49,700
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

2131
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:51,700
Tell her it's still cool.

2132
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:54,700
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

2133
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:58,800
I- I gotta go pee.

2134
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:00,800
I wanna go home.

2135
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:04,500
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2136
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:07,500
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2137
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:10,900
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2138
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,200
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2139
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:18,200
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2140
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:24,600
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

2141
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:41,500
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2142
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:44,600
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2143
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:51,800
[ Jules ]
Count it.

2144
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:00,700
How much is there?

2145
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:04,500
About 1,500 dollars.

2146
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:07,800
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2147
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:11,100
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2148
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:13,300
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2149
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:17,300
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2150
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:20,800
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2151
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,900
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2152
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:26,800
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2153
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:29,800
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2154
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,800
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2155
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:36,300
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

2156
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:41,100
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2157
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:43,800
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2158
02:26:44,900 --> 02:26:46,800
Not regularly, no.

2159
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:49,300
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2160
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:52,900
Ezekiel 25:17.

2161
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,800
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2162
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:57,800
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2163
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:59,800
and the tyranny of evil men.

2164
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:03,300
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2165
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,900
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2166
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:10,000
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2167
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,300
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2168
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:17,500
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2169
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:20,600
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2170
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:24,200
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2171
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:27,700
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2172
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:30,900
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2173
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2174
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:37,000
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2175
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,500
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2176
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:43,000
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2177
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2178
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,900
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2179
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,900
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2180
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,500
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2181
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,500
Or it could mean...

2182
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:03,000
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2183
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:07,100
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2184
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:09,400
Now, I'd like that.

2185
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:12,400
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2186
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:14,300
The truth is,

2187
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:17,300
you're the weak...

2188
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:22,100
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2189
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:25,400
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2190
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:29,600
I'm tryin' real hard...

2191
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:32,000
to be the shepherd.

2192
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:49,200
Go.

2193
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,400

leaving now.

- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
