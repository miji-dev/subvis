- opus server was down a few weeks
- opus dump ain't useful 'cause of lacking meta data
- manually created a list of available movies out of a HUGE file
- xml-rpc for node? yeah, piece of cake!
- useragent for os api? came a few weeks after request
- using opensubtitles client for node? sure, but first let me change the whole shit fuck
- jade works after a whole bit of training
- SubModel must be changed multiple times a day
- SubModel can be passed to the client by manually stringifying all methods on the server ...
- ... and eval them on the client
- d3 ... better use a plugin
- epoch works but is not comprehensive enough
- c3 maybe?
